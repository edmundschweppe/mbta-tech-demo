    <!--

        Simple React-based web page to show live train departure times for a particular MBTA
        commuter rail station, using the MBTA's V3 API.

        This code is Copyright (C) 2018 by Edmund Schweppe, and is only intended for use as
        a technical demonstrator.

        There would be a *lot* of additional work needed to make this something that could
        honestly be deployed to production, including:
            Using site-specific, production copies of the React and React-DOM code
            Running the Babel JSX conversion server-side
            Running all the code through appropriate minifiers
            Separating Javascript code into appropriate files
            Taking advantage of If-Modified-Since and Last-Modified headers
            Enhanced UI to support station selection
            And maybe adding some CSS to make this not ugly ...
